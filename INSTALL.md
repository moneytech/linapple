### Debugging and Profiling

By default, the `make` command will compile an optimized version of `linapple`.

It is possible to compile a version with debugging symbols. To do so, you must
set the `DEBUG` environment variable:

    DEBUG=1 make

If you would like to also include extra code that writes profile information
suitable for the analysis program `gprof`:

    PROFILING=1 make
